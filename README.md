#README: Lesson Feedback Generator

##What is this about?
In my day-job, I am an Assistant Principal in a large secondary school and frequently visit colleagues classrooms and offer notes, feedback and advice on their lessons.  It's my primary responsibility.

Sometimes I find myself stuck for words; it's been a tiring day and I'm all out of ideas, the lesson was 'so-so' and there's nothing to get really excited about or to moan about, or I just don't feel very original.

What I really need is something to randomly make the comments for me, so I can share then with the member of staff.  Which brings us to this!
